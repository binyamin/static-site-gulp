# Static-site Setup
My workflow for making static-sites, using [gulpjs](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp).

## Overview
This system is built with gulp plugins, so you can install just the features you need. The goal is to cover some basic features in a pluggable fashion.

I'd love to see similar systems from other people. Let me know what you build!

## Contributing
This is mainly a personal project, so I don't expect any contributions. That said, I'm open to all suggestions and/or contributions. You may want to look at [the roadmap](https://github.com/binyamin/static-site-setup/blob/main/roadmap.md).
